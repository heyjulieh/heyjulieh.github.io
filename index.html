                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to help businesses find a creative voice for their unique brand through practical and thoughtful design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a digitally connected world, customers are searching for genuine and unique products and experiences and they’re doing so through a variety of devices, from desktop to mobile, to good ol’ fashioned window shopping. Wherever your customers are, it’ our goal to help your business connect with them through cohesive and compelling solutions.
                </p>
                <h3>We're L.A. Based</h3>
                <p>
                    We’re a small Los Angeles based team born and raised in sunny California with a passion for modern & bold design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've travelled the world and worked in public and private companies, including some of the world’s biggest tech companies in the Bay Area. With over a decade of experience working with Fortune 500 companies on their brand strategies and business plans, as well as endless insight and inspiration from our world travels, we felt it was time we took our passion outside of the corporate 9-5. That’s when & how (pardon the pun) & why we decided to focus on helping small businesses find the solutions they need to succeed.
