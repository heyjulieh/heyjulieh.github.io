                          We've travelled the world and worked in public and private companies, including some of the world’s biggest tech companies in the Bay Area. With over a decade of experience working with Fortune 500 companies on their brand strategies and business plans, as well as endless insight and inspiration from our world travels, we felt it was time we took our passion outside of the corporate 9-5. That’s when & how (pardon the pun) & why we decided to focus on helping small businesses find the solutions they need to succeed.
